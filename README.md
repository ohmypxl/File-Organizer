# Simple File Organizer
This program will try to organize your file at ease, even though the implementation is a bit "hard-coded".
This program is merely a "learning" object for those who want to know how you can make something like this without even trying to rely too much into third-party lib at all, since making this is easy enough (at least at my understanding xd)

## Installation
Make sure to clone the repo without changing it's folder name, otherwise you'll confused yourself.

Simply go with:
```git
git clone https://github.com/pxlrl/file-organizer.git
```

And there you go!

## Setting up custom actions

### Thunar (Linux)
For thunar users, there is custom action you can use, and then for the command prompt, simply use:
```sh
python3 path/to/file-organizer %f
```

### Explorer (Windows)
For windows users, good luck finding out how to do it :P
